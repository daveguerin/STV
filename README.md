# STV
A Swift Packge of the amazing **Sensible TableView** framework by [Sensible Cocoa](http://sensiblecocoa.com/).

iOS 13 compatibility, Xcode 11 compatibility, and Swift Packaging by [dgApps](http://dgapps.ie/). Although it's now a Swift Package STV is still all glorious Objective C! This version is not so much forked from the [open source version](https://github.com/wizgod/STV) from [wizgod](https://github.com/wizgod), as ripped apart and then rebuilt into a SPM compatible format.

### What is Sensible TableView?
**Sensible TableView** (STV) is a Swift Package that drastically simplifies iOS table view development, while focusing on delivering a simple and enjoyable developer experience. Every single thing that can be done with normal table views can still be done with STV, only a lot easier. Have a custom UITableView subclass? No problem, STV flawlessly integrates with that. A custom cell? Even better! Custom view controllers? STVâ€™s bread and butter! STV elegantly reduces the amount of work you have to do to an absolute bare minimum!

Based on countless user testimonials and feedback, [Sensible Cocoa](http://sensiblecocoa.com/) found that developers were saving on average about 70% of their development time when they started using STV in their apps. What this means is that an app that would normally take weeks or even months for to develop alone, can now be conceived in just a matter of days using STV. Since STV keeps your code very short, simple and straight forward, maintenance suddenly becomes much easier.
